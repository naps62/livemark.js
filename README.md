An embbedable and fully customizable Markdown editor with live preview

## What is this?

This is my attempt at building a markdown web text editor, that allows full
customization, and is easily used in any web application

Many editors exist already exist, but mostly they don't provide all of the
functionality or customization options i desired. So i went on to build my own,
and this is the result

## What is Markdown

First of all, if you don't know, this probably isn't for you...

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, described as both easy-to-use and
easy-to-read. Markdown can be converted directly to HTML, and so it is widely
used accross the web. For example, this file you're reading right now was
written with it (you can see the actual source
[here](https://raw.github.com/coreyti/showdown/master/README.md), isn't that
nice?

## What can i do with it?

As a web developer, you should be able to:

* Easily embbed this in your web applications
* Access it's contents as a regular textarea
* Customize any visual aspect of the editor, to adapt it to your app

## Dependencies

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [showdown.js](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown)
